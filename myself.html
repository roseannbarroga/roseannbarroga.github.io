<h2 style = "color: white;"> I have the ability or skill in resolving some problems and making it better <br>
than the other one. I like how transforming and upgrading a new one idea to <br>
a more powerful and impressive one. But, I gave this personality that is not<br>
satisfied to what I have done. I am doubting myself. Everything I do is not enough <br>
for me. I always have this mindset that my work is not the best. <br>
Afterall, I can clearly see myself as one of the employee who has <br>
a high position in a company of IT industry.</h2>
